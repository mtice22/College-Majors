# Introduction
This project is based on a Five Thirty-Eight article that used college major data to find the highest paying majors. 

Five Thirty-Eight article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ 

The original article only ranked the highest and lowest median salaries. With so much valuable data, there is room for a lot more analysis. 
This project is done strictly out of interest and to practice SQL and Python coding skills.
